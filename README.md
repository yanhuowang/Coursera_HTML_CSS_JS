## 3. Hello & GoodBye
Loop over an array of names and print out either a hello or goodbye to that name to the browser console. If the name starts with a letter j or J, print out Goodbye JSomeName. If the name starts with any other letter, print out Hello SomeName.

## 4. Random specials
The front page of our web app contains 3 clickable tiles: Menu, Specials, and Map. 
When the user clicks on the Specials tile, the web app takes the user to the Specials menu, but to a random single category menu page, listing menu items in the category, be it "Lunch", "Dinner", "Sushi", etc. That way, any random category can become the Specials! 

Practice of ajax.
