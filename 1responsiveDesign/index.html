      </div>
      <p> HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document. </p>

        <h2> JavaScript </h2>
      </div>
      <p> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates and regular expressions, but does not include any I/O. </p>
